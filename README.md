## Description

Live Website: https://www.reliefandrotations.com

Relief and rotations is a Web App utility for managing employee scheduling.  The app was built using the MERN stack and deployed via Heroku and also on a dedicated server at www.reliefandrotations.com.  The Idea revolves around simplicity.  Three user catagories interact with each other in order to produce and maanipulate data on a central, companywide calendar.  The calendar displays requests for time off or "relief" in a pending and approved state.  The three categories of users are: Administrator, relief, and employee.  Our app makes use of roles in order toa sign functioanlity to one that the other would not get.  More features are yet to come!
